You can draw brush strokes along the ruler.

By clicking the __"Show ruler"__ button, the ruler will be displayed at the lower left position of the canvas. <br />
This ruler has the same feature as curves in vector layers. <br />
The red dot in the ruler is the starting point of the ruler.

When the __"Start drawing from the starting point of the ruler (red point)"__ is unchecked, the brush stroke will be from the point of the shortest distance between the position touched with the brush and the ruler.

By clicking the __"Start editing"__ button, you will be able to change the shape of the ruler.
