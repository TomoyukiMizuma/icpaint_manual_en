![layer_mask](./image/layer_mask.png)

You can partially hide the drawing contents by using a layer mask. <br />
A layer mask has an opacity (0 ~ 255). <br />
You can also create a layer mask for the group. <br />
If you create a layer mask for the adjustment layer, you can adjust the part to be affected by the adjustment layer.
