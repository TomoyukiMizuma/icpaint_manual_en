You can open 3D models in gltf and glb files. <br />
You can transfer the look of 3D to the 2D canvas as it is. <br />
You can also transfer the line art of 3D to the 2D canvas. <br />
You can use the transferred canvas to create your illustration. For example, use it as a background for an illustration.

3D models can be created in 3D software such as [blender](https://www.blender.org/) or Autodesk Maya. <br />
You can also download 3D models from sites like [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/).

Clicking the __"Replace"__ button will remove all previously loaded 3D models and leave only the newly loaded 3D model. <br />
You can add a 3D model by clicking the __"Add"__ button.

You can select one gltf from multiple loaded gltfs by clicking __"List of loaded gltf"__. <br />
You can move/rotate/scale the selected gltf.

You can select the node (object) in the selected gltf by clicking __"List of all nodes of selected gltf"__. <br />
You can move/rotate/scale the selected node.

You can select the material in the selected gltf by clicking __"List of all materials"__. <br />
You can adjust the parameters of the selected material.

The __"Material (gltf compliant)"__ section lists the material parameters according to the gltf specification. <br />
3D models created with 3D software such as blender are reflected in the parameters in this "Material (gltf compliant)" item. <br />
[Check this site for saving gltf in blender.](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/import_export/scene_gltf2.html#gltf-2-0)

3D models downloaded from sites like [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/) may look different in sketchfab than in icpaint. <br />
In that case, enabling KHR_materials_unlit (single color) might give the same look.

* "Sun light (directional light)" is enabled for all materials when loading gltf or glb files. You can uncheck the "Sun light (directional light)" checkbox after importing.
* Point lights and spot lights are not supported (KHR_lights_punctual)
* The animation of 3D models is not supported.
* Lighting by emissiveFactor etc. is not supported.
* It does not support casting shadows for 3D models.
* KHR_draco_mesh_compression, EXT_meshopt_compression, KHR_mesh_quantization are not supported.
* ktx2 (image format) is not supported (KHR_texture_basisu)
